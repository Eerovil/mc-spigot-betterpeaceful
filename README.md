The pacifist mode

This mod makes all mobs peaceful (will not attack players). Additionally, attacking mobs will not cause damage. Instead, they will drop items as if they were killed by the player.

Compass is modified that it will teleport the player home, then to another player, and another... cycling through all players.

The ender dragon will be immediately killed when it spawns.

Fire damage is disabled (not lava though)
